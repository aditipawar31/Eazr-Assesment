# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering - Eazr Assessment

## Overview
This project involves segmenting customers based on their transaction behavior using k-means clustering. The goal is to enhance Eazr's security measures and tailor marketing strategies more effectively. The assessment includes clustering implementation, cluster analysis, and conceptual questions related to AI/ML in a fintech context.

## Project Structure
- **EAZR/** - Directory containing all project files.
  - **`customer_segmentation.ipynb`** - Jupyter notebook used for clustering implementation, cluster analysis, and visualizations.
  - **`conceptual_and_scenario_questions.docx`** - Word document containing answers to the conceptual and scenario-based questions.
  - **`elbow_method.png`** - PNG file with the elbow method graph.
  - **`cluster_graph.png`** - PNG file with the cluster visualization.

## Instructions

### Google Colab
1. **Upload the Notebook to Google Colab:**
   - Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - Upload the `customer_segmentation.ipynb` file from the `EAZR` folder.

2. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform customer segmentation and generate results.
